- Permanantly saved in a DB.
Features:
-----------
- It is saved in DB as precompil ed object.
- Procedures executed explicitly.
	execute/exec Proc_name(ArgVal1 Datatype, ArgVal2 Datatype.....);
- Procedures also executed implicitly using procedure calling statements.
 	Proc_name(ArgVal1 Datatype, ArgVal2 Datatype.....);
- You can call it as from other procedure, Functions, program and package also. But you can't call from select statement. 
- Procedure may or may not take arguments runtimes. that is Procedures are static and dynamics.
- By default procesures should not return any values to the calling areas.

Static Procesure: Not Take argument as a parameters
Dynamic Procedure: Take argument as a parameters

Syntax:
create [or replace] procedure proc_name		}	
[(ArgVal1 Datatype, ArgVal2 Datatype.....)]	}	SPEC
is/as						}
<declare>
Begin						}
-----						}
-----						}
-----						}	Body
EXCEPTION					}
------						}
------						}
End [proc_name];				}
